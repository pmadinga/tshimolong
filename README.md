## What is due
A three page web app to collect survey data that can be presented.

-  [x]  The web app must collect personal details, food preferences and time spending preferences
-  [ ] Submit the survey data a database
-  [ ] Query the stored data and manipulate it to the defined specifications of the results page

## Deliverables

- **Landing Page**  
  The landing page must contain two links navigation link. A link to **Fill out the survey** and a link to **View the results**
  
- **Survey page**  
  Here a user will be able to 
  1. Input their personal information, 
  2. Select food(s) of their choice
  3. Select their time spending preferences on a scale of 1 - **strongly agree** to 5 - **strongly disagree** (rating formatted)

- **Results page**
  The results from the survey will be available on the **results** page. From the submitted wireframes I think I can segment the results into 3 data views
  
  1. Statistical numbers in **plain text**
  2. Percentages of food preferences in a **pie chart**
  3. Averages of time spending in a **bar chart**

## Solution stack and why?

### Design

The design does form a part of the tech stack I believe, none of the code delivered will be possible without the **DESIGN**. Breaking it down I will have the UI mockup design, thereafter I will have the archetecture design. 

### Softwares to be used for the design
- AdobeXD - Since the assignment already resembles wireframes, I will jump straight to the UI mockups
- diagrams.net - a free wireframing tool with expanded tools to design software logic

### Here are my front end UI designs
